This project was completed for the BS Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University, Computational Graphics and Visualization, a 300-level course dealing mainly with OpenGL.

This final project specifically helped me learn new skills by forcing me to learn how to program shaders in the C programming language, use linear algebra for different transformation matrices, and how to utilize the GPU for complex graphics tasks. One very important skill that was learned as a side-effect was how to use CMake during the build process which will transfer to other projects outside of graphics processing.

The design process was very straightforward during every step in the process from object translation to texturing to lighting to camera movement -- I followed the software specifications laid forth in the directions and rubric and worked backwards in order to create the final results.

This constant referral back to the software specifications and/or the rubric and providing every deliverable on-time will be invaluable skills that will apply to future work and projects.

One new development strategy I used, which was suggested by the sequencing of software requirements, was to use complete camera movement and speed to double-check my calculations when positioning objects in the scene. Without programming the camera movement first, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to position objects in the scene without having to revisit this step after programming the camera.

Iteration played a big role in developing this project since graphics processing is completely new to me. It was critical to develop and test in short stages in order to catch errors early rather than letting my technical debt accumulate.

My approach to developing code has definitely evolved during this project. Working on tight deadlines with unfamiliar concepts forced me to approach each milestone from the top down, making sure that I understood the abstract concepts and code at a high level before tackling the code at a low level. Luckily, we had a very comprehensive textbook which explained every detail and was organized very well.

We are a primarily visual species. While a very small portion of us don't mind entering commands on the command line, the vast majority want, need, and deserve visual representations of data concepts. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a 3D graphic with which you can interact is surely worth more. Computational graphics and visualizations give me the skills to help communicate those concepts effectively and efficiently.

Both from an educational and professional perspective, this course and project have helped me understand the importance of high-performance graphics not only in ways that are traditional, such as gaming and 3D modeling, but also in other areas where it might not be so obvious. It goes without saying, given the current state of artificial intelligence, that a solid grasp of directly programming the GPU will be an invaluable skill going forward.
